**Who am I**

I am full-stack software developer with a passion for cutting edge technology, learning and impactful projects. My journey within software engineering has allowed me to gain the skills necessary to create clean, maintainable code by following TDD processes and agile designs. Through my self-directed learning, I have developed full-stack projects in Ruby and JavaScript; and collaborated in developing a Rails web app and an iOS app. Currently, I am working on a personal project using Python - a full stack interactive web app that will show information on enforced disappearances in Mexico.

My self-awareness has played an essential role in my learning and development. Along with my warm and cheerful personality, I have been able to thrive and be true to myself and others I work with.

Throughout my self-directed learning, I have developed the skills to learn any language I have set myself to learn. Thus allowing me to explore my interests and proving my language agnostic skills.

## Skills

### Curious and eager to learn

I began learning how to code half way through my part-time Master alongside working full-time in a high-pressure job. While my time was limited, my motivation and eagerness to learn programming kept me going.

At first, I started by reading and watching coding basics for at least 1 hour every day, using online resources like Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, Udemy and Youtube. Attending workshops by rails girls in London and meetups where I have met great like minded enthusiastic learners.

I knew I wanted to immerse myself in the world of software engineering, and while I had my doubts about being capable of doing such thing(in the sense that I had never done a technical degree) I knew this is what I wanted to do and get really good at. I started looking for bootcamps in London and Europe and after careful consideration I decided on my choice.


Throughout my journey, I have been able to become confident with self-directed learning and find what tools and processes help me learn the best. My ability to research and learn new tools and techniques, keeping up to date with the latest libraries, frameworks and languages has let me build some amazing projects and given me the confidence to create based on my interests.


### Problem Solving

My eagerness to find solutions to pressing issues and solving problems led me into the world of software development. I enjoy being part of solving problems. I find this particularly useful when learning how to code since most of the time, coding is about debugging. I see this as a fun challenge to take. Knowing that at the end of every debugging session, my code is going to work, only adds up to the excitement of making bigger programs work. This was particularly useful on our final project, creating a iOS app for air quality by using tech stack we had never used: Swift, Xcode, Mapbox, Alamofire. Towards the final day of production, we still had to add a very important feature: showing annotations of air quality details when clicked. Since we had other features to work on, I put myself up for this task. While the task itself was not hard, debugging the new implemented code into the already in use code was a task in itself. I solved this by breaking down the problem into mini steps and focusing on making one function work at a time. Once this had been done, the other steps were easier to accomplish.

### I adapt to new concepts and situations quickly

I love learning and embracing new things, concepts and ideas. It truly excites me to know that I know so little and that there is so much to learn and experience. 
I came to the UK when I was 17 years old from Mexico, on my own. I took this step because I wanted to study abroad and follow my dream of being good at researching all things crime. My first weeks were a complete culture shock, as a Mexican, the British culture and way of life was very different. But within few months, I found myself getting invoved with some interesting non-governmental organisations, one of them: 'Stop the Traffik' (an organisation raising awareness on human trafficking) by volunteering and attending their meetups as well as being part of the University female football team. My first place to live in the UK was Manchester, for a year of pre-university course. After this, I moved to Liverpool for my degree where I lived for 4 years. Following this I moved to Southampton. I believe this demonstrates my ability to adapt to new places, concepts and situations naturally.

### Thrive on new challenges

Working along people from all over the world in different parts of Europe, doing humanitarian or impact research makes me feel alive. During my time in Lesvos, working with an NGO in the emergency response team and search and rescue, I was able to connect in a deeper level with colleagues and people who were all in a challenging situation. Working as part of a team whose work is to welcome incoming refugees and have the human and professional skills to work together on a process that is already emotionally and physically daunting for the refugees, allowed me not just to build stronger solidarity and humility but it reinforced my ideals of working towards a better and fairer society.


## Experience

- **UNODC United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime** (Vienna, Austria): January 2019 

SHERLOC Database Contributor:
The SHERLOC portal is an initiative to facilitate the dissemination of information regarding the implementation of the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. During this month, I contributed to the database by conducting an extensive research and analysis of a cybercrime case.

- **Lighthouse Relief** (Lesvos, Greece): March 2017 - May 2017

Field Officer:
First aid help and orientation is given to refugees crossing from Turkey to Greece on the shore landing area in the north of Lesvos. I provided logistical organisation of the camp. During night watch shifts my team of three would watch the waters between Greece and Turkey in search of incoming boats; crucial work since it permits the SAR (Search and Rescue) crews to be directed to these refugee boats. We would also communicate and partner with other NGOs in the area to have the most straightforward landing and welcoming of refugees.

- **Aldi** (Various Locations, England): March 2015 - October 2018

Deputy Manager:
Aldi is a very fast-paced working environment and I need to be on top at everything I do. Productivity targets are high, therefore focus, speed and quality are priorities. I worked closely with the Store Managers and deputise when they were away. My main duties included: Managing the team to meet the company's KPI targets, customer service including resolving complaints, supporting and motivating team members, setting up the store for deliveries, cashing up and banking, and administration.

- **Teach a Man to Fish** (London, England): October 2014 - February 2017

Project Assistant (part-time, home based position):
a Non-Governmental Organization based in London which provides future generations of entrepreneurs living in rural areas of Central America with the tools and education required for a successful process in their start up projects. I have given assistance to the Central American team by translating projects into Spanish.

- **Aldi** (Winchester, England): August 2014 - March 2015

Assistant:
During this time as a Store Assistant I proved myself to be committed, reliable and constant on my given tasks.  

- **Anna Freud Centre** (London, England): April 2014 - July 2014

Research Assistant:
The Centre had at the time, decided to expand its services and  planning to offer psychiatric evaluations of its young patients with any sort of court involvement. I helped the Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists at the Centre in producing the report necessary for establishing this service.

- **International Anti-Corruption Academy** (Laxemburg, Austria): September 2013 - December 2013

Intern, External Relations and Protocol:
During my time at IACA, I was able to engage in diplomatic meetings for translation purposes. I compiled detailed research on corruption issues and anti-corruption measures on Mexico, Colombia and Spain. This research was part of the portfolio in diplomatic meetings between the Dean and the diplomatic missions of such countries.

## Hobbies & Interests

* Travelling/Exploring - I love travelling and encountering new places and cultures.
* Learning languages - Spanish being my first tongue offers me the advantage to talk to most of Latin America, but coming to the UK, I knew I wanted to learn other languages, so I immersed myself in French during my Bachelors and most recently German.
* Colours, textures and food - As a Mexican, I am a huge fan of colorful things, be it clothes, spaces, anything. 
* Personal growth - I find meaning in continuously evolving and improving myself through forms of expression like yoga, meditation, colouring, reading, informing myself and learning from others.
